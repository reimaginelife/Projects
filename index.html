      <!--There was a lot to the website's elements that I did not fully understand, such as how it utilized <ul> without
    indentation, spacing between the links, how the menu condensed into a 'Three Line' icon when the window is smaller,
  and other more Javascript/CSS based coding.

I did, however, understand the fundamentals such as anchors, div, span, and such. Also, I looked up how to create more space
in between the navigation links so they don't look too bunched up together in one line.

The anchor references were additional pages to the site, so I just linked them as such instead of copying and pasting each
individual link for each page.-->
